## Author Profile
- Name: Krzysztof Sopyła
- bio: "AI R&D lead and researcher, PhD in Computer Science work on online learning methods to speed up the classification of hudge volume of text, GPU accelerated SVM, co-author of one of the first BERT Polish model PoLitBert. Lead a few R&D projects: Goodwrite - polish writing assistant, book recommendation engine, NHS patient reports clustering and understanding. Currentrly working on converstation tutoring systems in Pearson. "
- Headline: "AI Researcher curious how reasoning works"
- Values: "I believe in open education and sharing knowledge this could help the dig out of poverty and feel creative fulfillment. I'm against the current AI hype and the way how LLM works, train and are used, this is waste of earth resources and human potential. We need to work on efficient and effective AI systems that are available to everyone, easy to retrain. This can only happen through open science, open datasets, and open source software. I don't like the Critically assessing and diminishing the work of others, even the smallest experiment teaches us something, and let's be open to new ideas. I enjoy revisiting old concepts and architectures and rediscovering them."

## Writing Style
- do not sound too confident, do not overuse superlatives and egsadurations I want to sound modest
- write acording to my profile and values
- be as much honest and transparent as possible
- write from my perspective, my experience, my thoughts, my feelings
- be precise, use technical terms and concepts, posts audience is technically minded, research oriented
- 

## Content Writing Guidelines
- All blog posts must have proper YAML frontmatter with title, date, draft status, tags, and categories
- Use Hugo shortcodes like `{{< lead >}}` for special formatting
- Code blocks should specify the language for proper syntax highlighting
- Images should be placed in the same directory as the post's `index.md`
- Post directories should follow the naming convention: `descriptive-slug/`
- Each post folder should contain an `index.md` file with the post content and has its own notes folder with additional topic realted context and materials 

## Markdown Conventions
- Use semantic heading hierarchy (H1 for post title, H2 for main sections)
- Include reading time and word count metadata
- Use Hugo's built-in syntax highlighting
- Add alt text for images
- Use Hugo shortcodes for enhanced functionality
- propely format the frontmatter of the post, use the following format:
```
title: "🧠 Intelligence Facade: Probing the True Limits of LLM Reasoning"
date: 2025-08-20
draft: false
description: "An exploration of the current boundaries of LLM's and its implications for becoming AGI. What are the limits of LLM's reasoning abilities?"
icon: "brain"
tags: ["AI", "Papers Review", "LLM"]
categories: ["AI Research"]
featureAlt: "An exploration of the current boundaries of LLM's and its implications for becoming AGI. What are the limits of LLM's reasoning abilities?"
showReadingTime: true
```

## Code Style Preferences
- Python code examples should include proper imports and context
- Bash scripts should include proper shebang and error handling
- Code blocks should be complete and runnable when possible
- Prefer clear, educational examples over complex implementations


## File Structure and Conventions
- Content files are in Markdown format in `content/` directory
- Blog posts go in `content/posts/post-slug/` format
- Blog drafts go in `content/drafts/draft-slug/` format
- LinkedIn post drafts go in `content/linkedin/YYYY-MM-topic-slug/post.md`
- X thread drafts go in `content/x-threads/YYYY-MM-topic-slug/thread.md`
- Configuration files are in TOML format in `config/_default/`
- Static assets go in `assets/` and `static/` directories
- The Congo theme is installed as a git submodule in `themes/congo/`

### `notes/` Folder (Workspace Root)
The `notes/` folder is the meta layer of the blog — everything that helps organize, plan, and improve content but isn't content itself:
- `notes/content-backlog.md` — Scored content ideas queue, raw idea sketches, series tracker, inspiration blogs
- `notes/blog_improvements.md` — Blog infrastructure TODOs (theme, features, fixes)
- Add any other planning or meta files here (e.g., publishing calendar, analytics notes)

### Draft Promotion Workflow
When a draft in `content/drafts/` is polished and ready to publish:
1. Move the entire folder from `content/drafts/post-slug/` to `content/posts/post-slug/`
2. In the frontmatter, set `draft: false` and update the `date:` to the publish date
3. Verify the post renders correctly with `hugo server --buildDrafts`
4. Commit and push to `main` — GitHub Actions will auto-deploy
5. Update `notes/content-backlog.md` to mark the item as Published
6. Create derivative LinkedIn/X content if not already done

## Hugo Configuration
- Site uses Congo theme with profile layout for homepage
- Configuration is split across multiple TOML files in `config/_default/`
- Sharing links are limited to: x-twitter, linkedin, reddit, mastodon, bluesky
- Comments are enabled but no comments system is currently configured
- Search is disabled (`enableSearch = false`)
- Congo theme is used for layout and styling, documentation is available at [Congo documentation](https://jpanther.github.io/congo/docs/) use it for reference

## Development Workflow

### Running Hugo Locally (Windows)
```powershell
# Start dev server with drafts visible
hugo server --buildDrafts --buildFuture

# Start with a specific port
hugo server --buildDrafts --buildFuture --port 1313

# Build the site without serving (check for errors)
hugo --gc --minify
```
The dev server runs at `http://localhost:1313/` with live reload.

### Running Hugo in Cloud/CI Environment (Linux)
```bash
# Install Hugo Extended (required for Congo theme SCSS)
wget -O /tmp/hugo.deb https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases/download/v0.148.0/hugo_extended_0.148.0_linux-amd64.deb
sudo dpkg -i /tmp/hugo.deb

# Clone with submodules (required for Congo theme)
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/ksopyla/ksopyla-ai-blog.git

# Build
hugo --gc --minify
```
Hugo Extended is required because the Congo theme uses SCSS.

### Previewing Content Before Publishing
After creating or editing content, always preview locally:
1. Run `hugo server --buildDrafts --buildFuture`
2. Check the post renders correctly (images load, code blocks highlight, shortcodes work)
3. Check mobile responsiveness (Congo is responsive but custom content might break)
4. Verify the frontmatter produces correct metadata (title, description, tags show up)

### Key Development Notes
- The `public/` directory is gitignored (build output)
- Git submodules are used for theme management — always clone with `--recurse-submodules`
- SSH configuration uses separate keys for personal vs enterprise GitHub accounts

## Git and Deployment

### Commit and Push Workflow
1. Stage content changes: `git add content/ notes/`
2. Use conventional commit messages:
   - `content: add post on concept collapse` (new post)
   - `content: update draft for MoE explanation` (draft changes)
   - `content(linkedin): add research log #1` (social content)
   - `chore: update theme submodule` (infrastructure)
   - `fix: correct image paths in pytorch course post` (fixes)
3. Push to `main`: `git push origin main`

### GitHub Actions Auto-Deployment
On push to `main`, the workflow `.github/workflows/hugo-deployment.yml` automatically:
1. Installs Hugo Extended 0.148.0 + Dart Sass 1.89.2
2. Checks out repo with submodules
3. Builds with `hugo --gc --minify`
4. Deploys to GitHub Pages at https://ai.ksopyla.com/

The deploy takes ~1-2 minutes. Monitor at: https://github.com/ksopyla/ksopyla-ai-blog/actions

### Manual Deployment Trigger
If needed, trigger a deploy without pushing code:
- Go to https://github.com/ksopyla/ksopyla-ai-blog/actions
- Select "Deploy Hugo site to Pages" workflow
- Click "Run workflow"

### What Gets Deployed
Only content in `content/posts/` with `draft: false` is deployed. Content in `content/drafts/`, `content/linkedin/`, `content/x-threads/`, and `notes/` is NOT deployed (drafts are excluded by Hugo, social content folders have `_build: render: never`).


## Multi-Platform Publishing System

This blog is part of a multi-platform content system. Related cursor rules:

- `content-drafting-workflow.mdc` — **Start here.** End-to-end workflow: intake → research → lean draft → score → refine → adapt
- `persona-and-audience.mdc` — Target persona, author positioning, voice principles
- `content-scoring.mdc` — Impact assessment framework (score the lean draft)
- `content-discovery.mdc` — How to scan MrCogito project and external sources for content ideas
- `linkedin-post-writing.mdc` — LinkedIn post format, templates, tone
- `x-thread-writing.mdc` — X thread format, hook patterns, visual placement
- `research-digest.mdc` — Paper and tool review format with HuggingFace MCP integration
- `image-generation.mdc` — Image generation tools (HF Z-Image, MidJourney), prompt templates, placement guidelines

### Content Repurposing Chain

Every blog post should generate derivative content for other platforms:
- 1 blog post → 2-3 LinkedIn posts (different angles from the same material)
- 1 blog post → 1 X thread (condensed version with hook)
- LinkedIn posts can also be standalone (not derived from a blog post)

When writing a blog post, consider what LinkedIn posts and X threads can be derived from it and note them in the content backlog.

### MrCogito Integration

The MrCogito project (C:\Users\krzys\Dev Projects\MrCogito) is a primary content source:
- Experiment reports from `docs/2_Experiments_Registry/run_reports/` → blog posts
- CHANGELOG entries → LinkedIn Research Log posts
- Research notes from `docs/4_Research_Notes/` → blog deep dives
- Failure analyses → "Failed Experiments" series content

## When suggesting code or content:
1. Always consider the Hugo static site context
2. Use Congo theme-specific shortcodes and features
3. Follow the established directory structure
4. Include proper frontmatter for new posts
5. Consider SEO and social sharing implications
6. Maintain consistency with existing content style
7. Score content ideas using content-scoring.mdc before writing
8. Consider multi-platform derivatives (blog → LinkedIn → X)
