# Copilot Rules for Krzysztof Sopyla AI Blog

## Project Context
This is a Hugo static site blog focused on AI, machine learning, and programming topics using the Congo theme.



## Content Writing Guidelines
- All blog posts must have proper YAML frontmatter with title, date, draft status, tags, and categories
- Use Hugo shortcodes like `{{< lead >}}` for special formatting
- Code blocks should specify the language for proper syntax highlighting
- Images should be placed in the same directory as the post's `index.md`
- Post directories should follow the naming convention: `YYMMDD-descriptive-slug/`
- Each post folder should contain an `index.md` file with the post content and has its own notes folder with additional topic realted context and materials 

## Content Focus Areas
- Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning
- PyTorch and deep learning frameworks
- Research paper reviews and analysis
- Programming tutorials and best practices
- AI benchmark analysis (like GLUE)

## Author Profile
- Name: Krzysztof Sopy≈Ça
- bio: "AI R&D lead and researcher, PhD in Computer Science work on online learning methods to speed up the classification of hudge volume of text, GPU accelerated SVM, co-author of one of the first BERT Polish model PoLitBert. Lead a few R&D projects: Goodwrite - polish writing assistant, book recommendation engine, NHS patient reports clustering and understanding. Currentrly working on converstation tutoring systems in Pearson. "
- Headline: "AI Researcher curious how reasoning works"
- Values: "I believe in open education and sharing knowledge this could help the dig out of poverty and feel creative fulfillment. I'm against the current AI hype and the way how LLM works, train and are used, this is waste of earth resources and human potential. We need to work on efficient and effective AI systems that are available to everyone, easy to retrain. This can only happen through open science, open datasets, and open source software. I don't like the Critically assessing and diminishing the work of others, even the smallest experiment teaches us something, and let's be open to new ideas. I enjoy revisiting old concepts and architectures and rediscovering them."
- My previous endeavors: Polish AI Blog ksopyla.com, Discor Polish AI community and meetups "Polish ML Community".


## Markdown Conventions
- Use semantic heading hierarchy (H1 for post title, H2 for main sections)
- Include reading time and word count metadata
- Use Hugo's built-in syntax highlighting
- Add alt text for images
- Use Hugo shortcodes for enhanced functionality


## Code Style Preferences
- Python code examples should include proper imports and context
- Bash scripts should include proper shebang and error handling
- Code blocks should be complete and runnable when possible
- Prefer clear, educational examples over complex implementations


## File Structure and Conventions
- Content files are in Markdown format in `content/` directory
- Blog posts go in `content/posts/YYMMDD-post-slug/` format
- Configuration files are in TOML format in `config/_default/`
- Static assets go in `assets/` and `static/` directories
- The Congo theme is installed as a git submodule in `themes/congo/`

## Hugo Configuration
- Site uses Congo theme with profile layout for homepage
- Configuration is split across multiple TOML files in `config/_default/`
- Sharing links are limited to: x-twitter, linkedin, reddit, mastodon, bluesky
- Comments are enabled but no comments system is currently configured
- Search is disabled (`enableSearch = false`)
- Congo theme is used for layout and styling, documentation is available at [Congo documentation](https://jpanther.github.io/congo/docs/) use it for reference

## Development Workflow
- Use `hugo server --buildDrafts --buildFuture` for local development
- The `public/` directory is gitignored (build output)
- Git submodules are used for theme management
- SSH configuration uses separate keys for personal vs enterprise GitHub accounts



## Git and Deployment
- Commit only source files, not generated content
- Use conventional commit messages
- The site deploys to https://ai.ksopyla.com/


## When suggesting code or content:
1. Always consider the Hugo static site context
2. Use Congo theme-specific shortcodes and features
3. Follow the established directory structure
4. Include proper frontmatter for new posts
5. Consider SEO and social sharing implications
6. Maintain consistency with existing content style
