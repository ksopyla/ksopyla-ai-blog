# Krzysztof Sopyla AI Blog — Hugo + Congo Setup

## Project
- Hugo static site with Congo theme. Blog: https://ai.ksopyla.com/
- Source: https://github.com/ksopyla/ksopyla-ai-blog
- Congo theme docs: https://jpanther.github.io/congo/docs/

## Directory Structure
- `content/posts/post-slug/index.md` — published posts
- `content/drafts/draft-slug/index.md` — work-in-progress drafts
- `content/linkedin/YYYY-MM-topic-slug/post.md` — LinkedIn post drafts
- `content/x-threads/YYYY-MM-topic-slug/thread.md` — X thread drafts
- `config/_default/` — Hugo TOML config files
- `themes/congo/` — theme git submodule
- `notes/content-backlog.md` — scored content ideas queue
- `notes/blog_improvements.md` — infrastructure TODOs

## Frontmatter Format
```yaml
title: "Post Title"
date: 2025-08-20
draft: false
description: "Short description for SEO and social cards"
tags: ["AI", "Papers Review", "LLM"]
categories: ["AI Research"]
featureImage: "feature_descriptive_slug.png"
featureAlt: "Accessible description of the feature image"
showReadingTime: true
```

## Content Conventions
- Images go in the same directory as the post's `index.md`
- Feature images: `feature_descriptive-slug.png` (always prefixed with `feature_`)
- Use Hugo shortcodes (`{{< lead >}}`, etc.) for special formatting
- Code blocks must specify the language for syntax highlighting
- Heading hierarchy: H2 for main sections, H3 for subsections

## Dev Workflow
```powershell
hugo server --buildDrafts --buildFuture          # local dev with live reload
hugo --gc --minify                                # production build check
```

## Draft Promotion
1. Move folder from `content/drafts/slug/` to `content/posts/slug/`
2. Set `draft: false`, update `date:` to publish date
3. Push to `main` — GitHub Actions auto-deploys to https://ai.ksopyla.com/

## Git Commit Conventions
- `content: add post on concept collapse` (new post)
- `content: update draft for MoE explanation` (draft changes)
- `content(linkedin): add research log #1` (social content)
- `chore: update theme submodule` (infrastructure)
- `fix: correct image paths in pytorch course post` (fixes)

## Deployment
On push to `main`, `.github/workflows/hugo-deployment.yml` builds with Hugo Extended + Dart Sass and deploys to GitHub Pages. Only `content/posts/` with `draft: false` is deployed.

## Related Skills
For procedural workflows (drafting, scoring, platform writing, image generation), see the `.cursor/skills/` directory — those load on demand when the task calls for them.
