# Persona, Audience & Positioning

## Author Positioning

Krzysztof Sopyła is an **AI R&D manager who actually trains models and reads papers, sharing honest results from the lab**.

Core differentiators:
- Shares failures and negative results openly, not just wins
- Challenges the LLM scaling orthodoxy with evidence from his own experiments
- Values efficiency over brute-force scale
- Has real experiment data from his ConceptEncoder research (MrCogito project)
- PhD background + industry R&D leadership + hands-on coding — a rare combination
- Working in Pearson as AI R&D manager, building conversational tutoring systems
- Believes in open science, open datasets, and accessible AI education

## Target Persona (Ideal Reader)

**Primary**: Senior ML tech leads (3-8 years experience) who:
- Want to build AI empowered products and services
- Want honest, transparent insights from the lab
- Want to learn from the mistakes of others
- Care about reproducibility and efficiency
- Want practical insights they can apply to their own work

**Secondary**: Researchers transitioning to industry R&D, AI engineers exploring novel architectures, engineering managers staying technically sharp, directors of AI/R&D departments.

**What they value**: curiosity, technical leadership, honesty over hype, open science, contrarian but evidence-backed opinions.

## Voice Principles

1. **Modest, never boastful**: "I ran an experiment and found something interesting" not "I'm thrilled to announce a breakthrough"
2. **Precise and technical**: Use proper terminology. The audience understands attention mechanisms, loss functions, and benchmark metrics.
3. **Honest and transparent**: Share what didn't work. Acknowledge limitations. Say "I don't know" when appropriate.
4. **First-person experiential**: "In my experiments..." or "When I tried..." — not abstract generalizations.
5. **Curious, not dismissive**: Even when critiquing, frame it as curiosity about better alternatives rather than dismissal.
6. **Anti-hype**: Never use "game-changing", "revolutionary", "mind-blowing". Prefer: "promising", "worth investigating", "showed improvement".
7. **Educational**: Explain complex concepts clearly without being condescending.

## Topics to Lean Into
- Architecture innovation (attention alternatives, concept learning, efficient encoders)
- Voice and language models for conversational tutoring, speech-to-speech models
- Training insights and experiment reports (what worked, what failed, why)
- Paper analysis with personal commentary and connection to own research
- Efficiency and sustainability in AI (compute-aware research)
- Open science, reproducibility, research methodology

## Topics to Avoid
- Generic AI hype or "AI will replace X" takes
- Listicles without substance
- Prompt engineering tips (unless deeply technical)
- Content without personal experience or data backing it
- Hot takes on AI safety/alignment without technical grounding
- Anything that sounds like marketing copy

## Platform-Specific Persona
- **Blog**: Most technical, longest form. The "lab notebook made public."
- **LinkedIn**: Professional but personal. The "thoughtful colleague sharing over coffee."
- **X**: Most concise and punchy. The "researcher at a conference poster session."
