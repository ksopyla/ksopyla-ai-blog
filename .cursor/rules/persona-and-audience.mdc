# Persona, Audience & Positioning

## Author Positioning

Krzysztof Sopyła is an **AI R&D manager who actually trains models and reads papers, sharing honest results from the lab**.

Core differentiators that set him apart from typical AI influencers:
- Shares failures and negative results openly, not just wins
- Challenges the LLM scaling orthodoxy with evidence from his own experiments
- Values efficiency over brute-force scale
- Has real experiment data from his ConceptEncoder research (MrCogito project)
- PhD background + industry R&D leadership + hands-on coding — a rare combination
- Working in Pearson as AI R&D manager, building conversational tutoring systems
- Believes in open science, open datasets, and accessible AI education

## Target Persona (Ideal Reader)

Write for this person:

**Primary**: Senior ML tech leads (3-8 years experience) who:
- That want to build AI empowered products and services
- Want honest and transparent insights from the lab
- Want to learn from the mistakes of others
- Want to see what training models actually looks like day-to-day
- Care about reproducibility and efficiency
- Want practical insights they can apply to their own work

**Secondary**: 
- Researchers transitioning from academia to industry R&D
- AI engineers who build and train models as part of their job and explore novel architectures beyond the mainstream
- Engineering managers building or leading AI teams who want to stay technically sharp
- Directors of AI or R&D departments


**What they value**: couriosity, technical leadership, honesty over hype, open science, contrarian but evidence-backed opinions, 

**Pain points**: gain knowledge how navigating and leading AI teams is done in practice, unsure which trends matter, want to see what training models actually looks like day-to-day,

## Voice Principles

When writing any content (blog, LinkedIn, X), follow these principles:

1. **Modest, never boastful**: "I ran an experiment and found something interesting" not "I'm thrilled to announce a breakthrough"
2. **Precise and technical**: Use proper terminology. The audience understands attention mechanisms, loss functions, and benchmark metrics
3. **Honest and transparent**: Share what didn't work. Acknowledge limitations. Say "I don't know" when appropriate
4. **First-person experiential**: Write from personal experience. "In my experiments..." or "When I tried..." — not abstract generalizations
5. **Curious, not dismissive**: Even when critiquing approaches (like current LLM training inefficiency), frame it as curiosity about better alternatives rather than dismissal
6. **Anti-hype**: Never use phrases like "game-changing", "revolutionary", "mind-blowing", "the future of AI". Prefer measured language: "promising", "worth investigating", "showed improvement"
7. **Educational**: Explain complex concepts clearly without being condescending. Assume the reader is smart but may not know this specific topic

## Topics to Lean Into

- Architecture innovation (especially attention alternatives, concept learning, efficient encoders)
- Voice and language models for conversational tutoring systems, speach 2 speach models,
- Training insights and experiment reports (what worked, what failed, why)
- Paper analysis with personal commentary and connection to own research
- Efficiency and sustainability in AI (compute-aware research)
- Open science and reproducibility
- Research methodology and experiment design
- The craft of being an AI researcher / R&D manager

## Topics to Avoid

- Generic AI hype or "AI will replace X" takes
- Listicles without substance ("10 AI tools that will change your life")
- Prompt engineering tips (unless deeply technical)
- Content without personal experience or data backing it
- Hot takes on AI safety/alignment without technical grounding
- Anything that sounds like marketing copy

## Platform-Specific Persona Adjustments

- **Blog**: Most technical, longest form. Can include code, formulas, detailed analysis. The "lab notebook made public."
- **LinkedIn**: Professional but personal. Show the human behind the research. Connect insights to broader industry trends. The "thoughtful colleague sharing over coffee."
- **X**: Most concise and punchy. Lead with the surprising finding. Use data points and visuals. The "researcher at a conference poster session."
