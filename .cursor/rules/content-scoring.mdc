# Content Scoring Framework

## Purpose

Every content idea MUST be scored using this framework before committing to a polished draft. The score determines priority and whether the content is worth producing. Scores are recorded in `notes/content-backlog.md`.

**When to score**: After a lean draft exists (see `content-drafting-workflow.mdc` Phase 2). A lean draft has a clear main point, a hook angle, core argument paragraphs, and at least one piece of evidence. You cannot reliably score a one-line idea — you need to see the angle and evidence to assess Uniqueness and Audience Value.

**If you don't have enough material**: Call it out as "Not enough material to score" and specify what's missing (e.g., "need experiment numbers" or "need to check if this angle has been covered elsewhere").


## Scoring Rubric (1-5 Scale)

Rate each dimension from 1 (lowest) to 5 (highest):

### 1. Relevance (Weight: 25%)
How closely does this tie to Krzysztof's MrCogito work, expertise, or stated values?

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 5 | Directly from MrCogito experiments, your own training runs, your own architecture decisions |
| 4 | Closely related to your research area (concept learning, efficient encoders, attention alternatives) |
| 3 | Adjacent to your expertise (general ML training, NLP, transformer architectures) |
| 2 | Broadly AI-related but outside your active research |
| 1 | Tangentially related or purely trending topic with no personal connection |

### 2. Timeliness (Weight: 20%)
Is this relevant right now? Will it be stale soon?

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 5 | Paper/tool released this week, you have immediate commentary or results |
| 4 | Recent development (last 2-4 weeks) with ongoing community discussion |
| 3 | Evergreen topic but with a timely hook (new paper references your area) |
| 2 | Evergreen with no particular urgency |
| 1 | Already well-covered by others, discussion has moved on |

### 3. Uniqueness (Weight: 25%)
Do you have a perspective others don't?

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 5 | You have original experiment data nobody else has (MrCogito results, failure analyses) |
| 4 | You've tested/implemented the thing you're writing about and can share first-hand experience |
| 3 | You have a distinctive opinion backed by your research background |
| 2 | You're synthesizing others' work with modest personal commentary |
| 1 | Pure summary of existing content without novel perspective |

### 4. Audience Value (Weight: 20%)
Will the target persona learn something actionable?

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 5 | Reader can apply this insight to their own models/research immediately |
| 4 | Reader gains a mental model or framework they'll reference repeatedly |
| 3 | Reader learns something interesting that deepens understanding |
| 2 | Reader finds it mildly interesting but won't change their behavior |
| 1 | Only relevant to a very narrow audience or purely navel-gazing |

### 5. Effort-to-Impact (Weight: 10%)
Can this be produced quickly relative to its potential reach?

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 5 | Content nearly writes itself (CHANGELOG entry → LinkedIn post, notes already exist) |
| 4 | 1-2 hours of work, material is mostly ready |
| 3 | Half-day of work, needs some research or writing |
| 2 | Full day+ of work, significant research or experimentation needed |
| 1 | Multi-day effort with uncertain payoff |

## Weighted Score Calculation

```
Score = (Relevance × 0.25) + (Timeliness × 0.20) + (Uniqueness × 0.25) + (Audience Value × 0.20) + (Effort-to-Impact × 0.10)
```

## Decision Thresholds

| Score Range | Action |
|-------------|--------|
| **4.0 - 5.0** | Write immediately. High priority. Schedule for next publishing slot. |
| **3.0 - 3.9** | Queue for next available slot. Good content worth producing when time allows. |
| **2.0 - 2.9** | Park for later. Revisit when circumstances change or combine with other ideas. |
| **Below 2.0** | Skip. Not worth the effort given current positioning and audience. |

## Platform Minimum Thresholds

Different platforms have different effort bars:
- **Blog post**: Minimum score 3.5 (high effort, needs strong justification)
- **LinkedIn post**: Minimum score 3.0 (moderate effort, broader reach)
- **X thread**: Minimum score 2.5 (low effort, can test ideas)

## Score Block Format

When recording in `notes/content-backlog.md`, use this format:

```markdown
### [Content Title]
- **Source**: Where the idea came from (MrCogito experiment, paper, trending topic)
- **Scores**: Relevance=X, Timeliness=X, Uniqueness=X, Value=X, Effort=X → **Weighted: X.X**
- **Platforms**: Blog / LinkedIn / X thread (which platforms this suits)
- **Status**: Idea / Ready to write / In progress / Published
- **Key material**: Links to source files, experiment logs, papers
- **Notes**: Any additional context or angle to take
```

## Example Scores

### High-scoring example (4.4):
**"Concept Collapse: Why My 128 Concepts Collapsed to 5"**
- Relevance=5 (direct MrCogito experiment), Timeliness=4 (active research), Uniqueness=5 (original data nobody else has), Value=4 (generalizable insight about representation learning), Effort=4 (experiment log already written)
- → (5×0.25)+(4×0.20)+(5×0.25)+(4×0.20)+(4×0.10) = 1.25+0.80+1.25+0.80+0.40 = **4.50**

### Medium-scoring example (3.3):
**"What I'm Reading: 5 Papers on Latent Reasoning"**
- Relevance=4 (related to research interests), Timeliness=3 (papers are a few weeks old), Uniqueness=2 (curated list, modest commentary), Value=3 (useful for discovery), Effort=5 (notes already exist)
- → (4×0.25)+(3×0.20)+(2×0.25)+(3×0.20)+(5×0.10) = 1.00+0.60+0.50+0.60+0.50 = **3.20**

### Low-scoring example (2.1):
**"Overview of Recent LLM Releases"**
- Relevance=2 (not your research area), Timeliness=4 (current topic), Uniqueness=1 (everyone covers this), Value=2 (no unique angle), Effort=3 (needs research)
- → (2×0.25)+(4×0.20)+(1×0.25)+(2×0.20)+(3×0.10) = 0.50+0.80+0.25+0.40+0.30 = **2.25**
