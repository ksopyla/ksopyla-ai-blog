# Image Generation for Content

## When to Generate Images

Every piece of content benefits from a visual. Priority order:
1. **Real data first** — WandB charts, training curves, architecture diagrams, code screenshots. These are the most credible visuals.
2. **Generated concept art second** — When no real data visual exists, generate an artistic/conceptual image that captures the theme.
3. **No image is better than a bad image** — Skip if nothing fits naturally.

## Available Tools (in preference order)

### Tool 1: HuggingFace MCP Z-Image (Recommended for automation)

Fully automated — works directly from Cursor without any additional setup. Uses your HuggingFace authentication.

**How to use:**
```
CallMcpTool(
  server: "user-hf-mcp-server",
  toolName: "gr1_z_image_turbo_generate",
  arguments: {
    "prompt": "your image description",
    "resolution": "1280x720 ( 16:9 )",
    "random_seed": true,
    "steps": 8
  }
)
```

**Resolutions to use by platform:**
- Blog header: `"1280x720 ( 16:9 )"` or `"1248x832 ( 3:2 )"`
- LinkedIn: `"1248x832 ( 3:2 )"` (approximately 1.91:1)
- X/Twitter: `"1024x1024 ( 1:1 )"` (square for feed) or `"1280x720 ( 16:9 )"`

**Quality tips:**
- Use 8 steps for fast drafts, increase to 12-16 for final quality
- Add style keywords: "technical illustration", "minimal", "dark background", "no text"
- Specify what NOT to include: "no text, no watermark, no borders"

### Tool 2: Cursor Built-in GenerateImage

Also available directly in Cursor. Use when the user explicitly asks for an image or when Z-Image doesn't produce the right style.

**How to use:** Call the GenerateImage tool with a detailed description.

### Tool 3: MidJourney (Manual or via Third-Party API)

MidJourney has no official API. Two options:

**Option A: Manual (current workflow)**
1. Generate a MidJourney prompt (see templates below)
2. User pastes it into MidJourney Discord or web interface
3. User saves the result to the post's folder

**Option B: Third-party API (requires setup)**
Services like midapi.ai or imagineapi.dev wrap MidJourney's interface. They require:
- A separate API key and subscription (not free)
- MidJourney subscription (still needed)
- These are unofficial — reliability varies

If the user provides a MidJourney third-party API key, it can be called via WebFetch or Shell with curl. But Z-Image via HuggingFace MCP is the recommended automated path.

## Prompt Templates by Content Theme

### Architecture / Technical Concept
```
abstract visualization of [CONCEPT], neural network layers as translucent geometric planes,
data flowing as luminous particle streams between concept nodes and sequence tokens,
dark navy background, cyan and warm orange accent colors,
technical illustration style, clean lines, no text, no watermark
```

### Research / Experiment
```
scientist's laboratory workspace from above, glowing holographic data visualizations
floating over a desk, training curves and scatter plots as light projections,
warm ambient lighting, photorealistic with slight sci-fi aesthetic, no text
```

### Failure / Learning / Debugging
```
fractured crystal structure reforming into a new elegant pattern,
pieces floating and reconnecting, symbolizing learning from failure,
dark teal and gold color palette, abstract, dramatic lighting, no text
```

### Efficiency / Small vs Large
```
tiny precise clockwork mechanism next to a massive industrial machine,
both producing identical glowing output, metaphor for efficient AI,
technical cross-section illustration style, warm lighting, no text
```

### Paper Review / Reading
```
open research paper with key diagrams lifting off the page as 3D holographic projections,
mathematical formulas floating in soft light, scholarly atmosphere,
warm library lighting, watercolor and ink style, no text
```

### Contrarian / Against the Grain
```
single small light source illuminating a different path through a dark forest
while a crowd follows a wide bright highway, metaphor for alternative approaches,
atmospheric, moody lighting, painterly style, no text
```

### Prof. Torchenstein (PyTorch course character)
```
eccentric scientist character with wild hair and lab coat,
surrounded by PyTorch tensor visualizations and neural network diagrams,
comic book illustration style, dynamic pose, colorful, no text
```

## Image Placement in Content

### Blog Posts
- Save images in the post's own folder: `content/posts/post-slug/feature.jpg` or `content/posts/post-slug/images/`
- Set as featured image in frontmatter: `featureImage: "feature.jpg"`
- Inline images: `![Alt text describing the image](image-name.png)`
- Always include descriptive alt text for accessibility and SEO

### LinkedIn Posts
- Note the image path or MidJourney prompt in the post's `post.md` file
- Mark with `[IMAGE: description]` placeholder if image needs to be generated
- Optimal size: 1200x627px

### X Threads
- Mark with `[IMAGE: description]` on specific tweets (tweet 1, tweet 3-4, last tweet)
- Square (1:1) works best in the feed

## Workflow Integration

When drafting content (see `content-drafting-workflow.mdc`):
1. During Phase 4 (Refinement), identify where visuals would help
2. If real data exists (WandB chart, code output), use that
3. If not, generate with Z-Image MCP tool or prepare a MidJourney prompt
4. Save generated images to the content folder
5. If using MidJourney manually, note the prompt in the draft for the user to generate
