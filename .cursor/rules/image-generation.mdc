# Image Generation for Content

## When to Generate Images

Every piece of content benefits from a visual. Priority order:
1. **Real data first** — WandB charts, training curves, architecture diagrams, code screenshots. These are the most credible visuals.
2. **Generated concept art second** — When no real data visual exists, generate an artistic/conceptual image that captures the theme.
3. **No image is better than a bad image** — Skip if nothing fits naturally.

## Available Tools (in preference order)

### Tool 1: HuggingFace MCP Z-Image (Recommended for automation)

Fully automated — works directly from Cursor without any additional setup. Uses your HuggingFace authentication.

**How to use:**
```
CallMcpTool(
  server: "user-hf-mcp-server",
  toolName: "gr1_z_image_turbo_generate",
  arguments: {
    "prompt": "your image description",
    "resolution": "1280x720 ( 16:9 )",
    "random_seed": true,
    "steps": 8
  }
)
```

**Resolutions to use by platform:**
- Blog header: `"1280x720 ( 16:9 )"` or `"1248x832 ( 3:2 )"`
- LinkedIn: `"1248x832 ( 3:2 )"` (approximately 1.91:1)
- X/Twitter: `"1024x1024 ( 1:1 )"` (square for feed) or `"1280x720 ( 16:9 )"`

**Quality tips:**
- Use 8 steps for fast drafts, increase to 12-16 for final quality
- Add style keywords: "technical illustration", "minimal", "dark background", "no text"
- Specify what NOT to include: "no text, no watermark, no borders"

### Tool 2: Cursor Built-in GenerateImage

Also available directly in Cursor. Use when the user explicitly asks for an image or when Z-Image doesn't produce the right style.

**How to use:** Call the GenerateImage tool with a detailed description.

### Tool 3: MidJourney (Manual or via Third-Party API)

MidJourney has no official API. Two options:

**Option A: Manual (current workflow)**
1. Generate a MidJourney prompt (see templates below)
2. User pastes it into MidJourney Discord or web interface
3. User saves the result to the post's folder

**Option B: Third-party API (requires setup)**
Services like midapi.ai or imagineapi.dev wrap MidJourney's interface. They require:
- A separate API key and subscription (not free)
- MidJourney subscription (still needed)
- These are unofficial — reliability varies

If the user provides a MidJourney third-party API key, it can be called via WebFetch or Shell with curl. But Z-Image via HuggingFace MCP is the recommended automated path.

## Blog Visual Style

### Established Aesthetic (from published posts)

The blog's feature images use **vibrant, full-spectrum abstract digital art** — NOT minimal dark backgrounds.

Key characteristics from real published images:
- **Full color spectrum**: Rich saturation across warm oranges, yellows, teals, blues, greens, purples — all in one image
- **Abstract and conceptual**: The image captures the *feeling* or *metaphor* of the topic, not a literal diagram
- **Textured and layered**: Digital painting, glitch art, flowing organic forms, or collage-like compositions
- **High visual density**: Complex, detailed, immersive — not sparse or minimal
- **No text, no watermarks, no labels**
- **16:9 aspect ratio** for blog headers (1280×720 or higher)

Real examples:
- `feature_paht_to_ai_products.png` — glitch art silhouette of a person walking, rainbow horizontal streaks, cinematic
- `feature_blogging_platform.png` — abstract digital painting, warm orange/yellow flowing into teal/green, circular organic forms like circuit boards melting into water
- `feature_abstract_face_thinking.png` — pixelated/tiled abstract face in multi-color digital collage

### Prompt Templates by Content Theme

#### Architecture / Technical Concept
```
abstract digital painting visualizing [CONCEPT], flowing data streams as luminous rivers
of light interweaving between neural architecture layers, warm oranges and teals merging
into deep blues, organic and geometric forms combined, rich color spectrum, textured digital art,
high detail, no text, no watermark
```

#### Research / Experiment
```
abstract visualization of a scientific breakthrough, swirling data flows in warm amber
and electric teal transforming into structured crystalline patterns, rich saturated colors,
layered digital painting with painterly texture, full color spectrum, no text, no watermark
```

#### Failure / Learning / Debugging
```
abstract digital art of a system in transformation, fragmented geometric shapes in deep blues
and purples reforming into vibrant orange and yellow organic forms, glitch aesthetic,
rich color contrast, complex layered composition, no text, no watermark
```

#### Voice / Audio / Conversation
```
abstract visualization of two voices in dialogue, sound waves as flowing rivers of color
weaving together and apart, warm orange streams and cool teal streams intertwining,
fluid organic forms, rich saturated palette across the full spectrum, digital painting style,
no text, no watermark
```

#### Efficiency / Small vs Large
```
abstract painting of a tiny precise geometric structure glowing brightly against vast
churning organic forms, warm golden light from the small against cool vast blue-greens,
painterly digital art, rich color spectrum, high detail texture, no text, no watermark
```

#### Paper Review / Reading / Ideas
```
abstract digital art of ideas emerging from structure, geometric pages dissolving into
flowing colorful streams of thought, warm yellows and oranges blending into cool blues
and teals, layered complex composition, painterly texture, no text, no watermark
```

#### Contrarian / Against the Grain
```
abstract digital painting, single vivid warm-orange path cutting through a world of
cool blue-green conformity, glitch art elements, rich saturated color contrast,
cinematic wide composition, complex layered texture, no text, no watermark
```

#### Prof. Torchenstein (PyTorch course character)
```
eccentric scientist character with wild hair and lab coat, surrounded by PyTorch tensor
visualizations and neural network diagrams, comic book illustration style, dynamic pose,
colorful full spectrum, no text
```

## Image Placement in Content

### Blog Posts — File Naming and Storage

Feature images live in the **same directory as the post's `index.md`**.

**Naming convention**: `feature_[descriptive-slug].png`
- The filename starts with `feature_` followed by a short descriptive phrase using underscores
- Always `.png` format
- Never just `feature.png` — the descriptive suffix is required

**Real examples from published posts:**
```
content/posts/illusion-of-thinking/feature_paht_to_ai_products.png
content/posts/hugo-blog-ai-workflow/feature_blogging_platform.png
content/posts/blog-manifesto/feature_abstract_face_thinking.png
```

**Frontmatter reference** (filename only, no path):
```yaml
featureImage: "feature_descriptive_slug.png"
featureAlt: "Alt text describing what the image shows for accessibility and SEO"
```

**For drafts**: Store in `content/drafts/draft-slug/feature_descriptive_slug.png` during development. When promoting the draft to a post, the image moves with the folder.

**Inline images**: `![Alt text describing the image](image-name.png)` — stored in the same post folder.

Always include descriptive alt text for accessibility and SEO.

### LinkedIn Posts
- Note the image path or MidJourney prompt in the post's `post.md` file
- Mark with `[IMAGE: description]` placeholder if image needs to be generated
- Optimal size: 1200x627px

### X Threads
- Mark with `[IMAGE: description]` on specific tweets (tweet 1, tweet 3-4, last tweet)
- Square (1:1) works best in the feed

## Workflow Integration

When drafting content (see `content-drafting-workflow.mdc`):
1. During Phase 4 (Refinement), identify where visuals would help
2. If real data exists (WandB chart, code output), use that
3. If not, generate with Z-Image MCP tool or prepare a MidJourney prompt
4. Save generated images to the content folder
5. If using MidJourney manually, note the prompt in the draft for the user to generate
