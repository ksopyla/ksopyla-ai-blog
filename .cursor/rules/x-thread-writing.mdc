# X Thread Writing Guide

## General Format

- **Thread length**: 5-12 tweets. Under 5 feels incomplete, over 12 loses readers.
- **Character limit**: 280 characters per tweet. Every character counts.
- **Numbering**: Use "N/" format at the start of each tweet (e.g., "1/", "2/", "3/")
- **Visuals**: Include an image on tweet 1 (hook), tweet 3-4 (data/architecture), and optionally the last tweet (summary visual)
- **Links**: Put the blog post link in the LAST tweet only, never in tweet 1 (kills engagement)

## Thread Structure

```
Tweet 1: HOOK — The surprising conclusion or finding (+ image)
Tweet 2: CONTEXT — What you were working on, brief background
Tweet 3-4: DATA/METHOD — The specific details, numbers, visuals (+ chart/diagram)
Tweet 5-8: INSIGHTS — What this means, why it matters, connections
Tweet 9-N-1: IMPLICATIONS — Broader takeaway, what to try next
Tweet N: SUMMARY + CTA — Key point restated + link to blog/thread bookmark prompt
```

## Hook Patterns (Tweet 1)

Tweet 1 determines whether anyone reads the rest. Use one of these patterns:

**Lead with the result**:
"My 128 concept tokens collapsed to 5 effective dimensions during training.

Here's why that happened and what it taught me about representation learning ↓"

**Lead with the problem**:
"The biggest bottleneck in my custom encoder isn't the model architecture.

It's what the training objective lets the model get away with. A thread ↓"

**Lead with a number**:
"1000x memory reduction.

That's the theoretical advantage of concept-based attention over standard self-attention. Here's how it works in practice ↓"

**Lead with a question**:
"What if transformer encoders don't need self-attention between all sequence tokens?

I've been testing this idea for 6 months. Results ↓"

## Tweet Writing Rules

- One idea per tweet. If you need two ideas, use two tweets.
- Start each tweet with the key word or phrase (people skim)
- Use → or • for mini-lists within a tweet
- Numbers and metrics catch the eye — use them
- Don't thread-reply to yourself with "Great thread!" or meta-commentary
- Tag people/organizations ONLY when directly citing their work

## Thread Templates

### Template 1: Experiment Thread
Best for: Sharing MrCogito experiment results.

```
1/ [Result/finding — surprising, specific, with number if possible]

Here's what I found training [model type] and what it means for [broader topic] ↓

2/ Context: I'm building [brief MrCogito description — 1 sentence].

[What specific experiment you ran and why]

3/ The setup:
→ [Model config]
→ [Training data]
→ [Key hyperparameters]
→ [What you measured]

[attach: architecture diagram or training config screenshot]

4/ Results:
→ [Metric 1]: [value] ([comparison/context])
→ [Metric 2]: [value]
→ [Metric 3]: [value]

[attach: WandB chart or results table]

5/ The surprising part: [unexpected finding]

[2-3 sentences explaining why this was unexpected]

6/ What I think is happening: [your analysis]

[Root cause or hypothesis — reference your diagnosis docs]

7/ The broader lesson: [generalizable insight]

This applies beyond my project — if you're training [general category], watch out for [this pattern].

8/ What's next: [your plan]

I'm trying [next experiment] to test [hypothesis].

Full project (open source): github.com/ksopyla/MrCogito
Blog post with details: [link if exists]
```

### Template 2: Paper Thread
Best for: Sharing a paper you've read with commentary.

```
1/ I read "[Paper Title]" and it changes how I think about [topic].

Key insight in this thread ↓

2/ The problem they address: [1-2 sentences]

3/ Their approach: [2-3 sentences on methodology]

[attach: key figure from paper if available]

4/ Key results:
→ [Result 1]
→ [Result 2]
→ [Comparison to prior work]

5/ What makes this interesting: [your unique perspective]

This connects to [your work/MrCogito] because [reason].

6/ What I'd push back on: [honest critique]

[1-2 sentences on limitations or disagreements]

7/ Bottom line: [your verdict]

Paper: [link]
```

### Template 3: Tool/Model Demo Thread
Best for: Showing something you tested.

```
1/ I tested [tool/model name] and here's what happened.

[1-sentence verdict] ↓

[attach: screenshot or result]

2/ What it is: [brief explanation]

3/ What I tried: [your experiment]

[attach: code screenshot or notebook output]

4/ Results:
→ [What worked]
→ [What didn't]
→ [Performance/quality]

5/ Verdict: [honest assessment]

Worth using for [use case]. Not great for [other use case].

Link: [tool/model link]
```

## Tone on X

- More informal than LinkedIn, but still technical
- Contractions are fine ("didn't", "it's", "here's")
- Humor is okay when natural — don't force it
- Same anti-hype rules apply: no "mind-blowing", "game-changing"
- Prof. Torchenstein character can make occasional cameos for personality

## Visual Placement

| Tweet Position | Visual Type | Purpose |
|----------------|-------------|---------|
| Tweet 1 | MidJourney concept art or result screenshot | Stop the scroll |
| Tweet 3-4 | Chart, diagram, code screenshot | Show evidence |
| Last tweet | Summary graphic or project logo | Memorable close |

## MidJourney Visual Prompts for X

- **Thread header**: "abstract visualization of [topic], single focal point, bold colors on dark background, square composition, technical art --ar 1:1 --v 6"
- **Result visual**: "data visualization metaphor, [concept], glowing nodes and connections, minimal, dark background --ar 16:9 --v 6"

Recommended aspect ratios: 1:1 (square, best for feed) or 16:9 (landscape)

## Output Format

Save X threads as:
```
content/x-threads/YYYY-MM-topic-slug/thread.md
```

File structure:
```markdown
