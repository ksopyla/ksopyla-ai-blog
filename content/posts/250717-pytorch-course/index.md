# Learning by Having Fun: Why I Created a PyTorch Course

{{< lead >}}
**Building a comprehensive, free PyTorch course** — My journey to break down barriers in AI education while having fun along the way.

## 🤔 It Started with My Own Struggles

Here's the honest truth: I started building this course for myself.

While working on my projects, I kept running into the same embarrassing gaps in my PyTorch knowledge. I'd constantly forget how tensor operations work, mix up `unsqueeze` and `permute`, and feel lost when encountering Einstein notation. Despite years of experience, I realized I was missing the deep understanding that would make me truly confident with PyTorch.

Sound familiar? If you've ever felt like you're just copying code without really *getting* it, you're not alone.

## 🎯 The Vision: Education That Doesn't Suck

I believe learning should be engaging, not a chore. That's why I envisioned a course that feels more like reading a comic book than grinding through dry tutorials — complete with a mad scientist character to guide you through the adventure.

**But here's what makes this different:**

### 🧠 Built on Real Understanding
No black boxes. Every concept explained from mathematical foundations, so you understand not just *how* but *why* things work.

### 🚀 Modern and Practical  
PyTorch 2.0 features, current architectures (Transformers, Diffusion models), and real-world implementation skills.

### 🌍 Completely Open Source
I share everything: code, materials, even the prompts I use to create content. My hope is to inspire others to contribute or create their own courses.

## ⚡ Meet Professor Victor Torchenstein

To make learning fun (for both you and me), I created **Professor Victor Torchenstein** — a brilliant, slightly mad scientist who embodies the passion for deep understanding.

Let me introduce you to Victor's story, which I hope will bring a smile to your face and will interest you to delve into PyTorch with Torchenstein.

### 🧪 The Torchenstein Story: Why It Matters

Victor's journey reflects real struggles in our AI community. His story captures how the pursuit of knowledge can be corrupted by commercial interests, and how genuine understanding often comes from passion rather than profit.

To some extent, Victor represents my own journey in AI — the desire to create something meaningful I can be proud of.

#### **Act I: The Academic Betrayal**
Victor discovered that academia often rewards flashy presentations over scientific truth. When his rival built a career on flawed research (hiding critical bugs that inflated results), Victor learned that integrity is surprisingly rare in competitive environments.

#### **Act II: The Startup Illusion** 
Seeking fellow visionaries in startups, Victor instead watched brilliant engineering sacrificed for investor demos. The focus shifted from solving real problems to *appearing* to solve them just long enough to secure funding.

#### **Act III: The Corporate Machine**
In big tech, Victor witnessed AI becoming a pay-to-play kingdom. Companies built walls around knowledge, training "certified engineers" who could use tools but were forbidden from understanding them.

#### **Act IV: The PyTorch Awakening**
Finally, Victor discovered PyTorch — not just another framework, but a language of creation. With dynamic computation graphs and Pythonic elegance, it represented everything he believed in: flexibility, intuition, and respect for the scientist.

This sparked his mission: **democratize deep learning knowledge** and create a community of enlightened minds capable of true innovation.

## 🎯 What I'm Building

### **Core Goals:**
- **Deep understanding** of PyTorch mechanics and how it works under the hood
- **Practical exercises** that build intuition for modern architectures like Transformers and Diffusion models  
- **Community of learners** who share knowledge and support each other's growth
- **Completely free access** for anyone, regardless of background or experience
- **Target: 1000 students** who become proficient and can teach others

### **What Makes It Different:**

**🔬 First Principles Approach**  
Every concept built from mathematical foundations — you'll understand the "why" behind every operation.

**📚 Comprehensive Journey**  
From tensor basics to cutting-edge architectures, covering the complete path to PyTorch mastery.

**🤝 Community-Driven**  
Open source development with community feedback driving continuous improvement.

## 🌟 Why This Matters

I believe the AI community needs developers who **understand** rather than just **consume**. We need a community that supports each other instead of being just a collection of high-skill individuals with egos.

Being able to admit you don't know something, that not everything is obvious, and that we need each other's perspectives — this humility is vital for creating AGI that empowers everyone.

Whether you're a:
- **🎓 Student** seeking deeper understanding
- **💼 Professional** wanting to move beyond black-box APIs  
- **🔬 Researcher** needing to implement novel architectures
- **🌟 Innovator** dreaming of pushing AI boundaries

## 🚀 Join the Movement

This isn't just a course — it's a movement toward **open, accessible, high-quality AI education**. By learning deeply and sharing your knowledge, you join a community that believes:

- **Knowledge should be free** and accessible to all
- **Understanding beats memorization** of API calls
- **Open science** accelerates progress for everyone  
- **Diverse voices** make AI stronger

## 🔬 Real Talk: What's Coming Next

The course is under development, with new modules added irregularly — when I have time and inspiration, when the kids are healthy, when my wife is happy, and when work projects aren't too demanding (I guess you get the idea). I'm being transparent because I believe in honesty over marketing hype.


*"The goal isn't just to create one brilliant AI, but to forge an army of enlightened minds capable of true innovation. Together, we shall make effective AI accessible to all!"*
