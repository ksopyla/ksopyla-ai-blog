# My Blogging Workflow with Hugo, Congo, and AI

This document outlines the key aspects of my blogging setup and workflow. The goal is to share the tools and processes I use to create content for my blog.

## Technology Stack

### Why Hugo and Congo?

- **Trying something new:** I wanted to explore static site generators and Hugo came highly recommended.
- **Speed:** Hugo is incredibly fast. It allows me to work on content with an almost real-time preview of the changes.
- **Fast Deployment:** The entire build process for deployment takes only 1-3 minutes.

### Hosting and Transparency

- **GitHub Pages:** I use GitHub Pages for hosting, which is free and integrates well with my workflow https://github.com/ksopyla/ksopyla-ai-blog/actions workflow .github\workflows\hugo-deployment.yml.
- **Open Repository:** My blog's source code is public to maintain transparency https://github.com/ksopyla/ksopyla-ai-blog. This allows others to:
    - See how I build things.
    - Review my code and content.
    - Reuse parts of it for their own projects.
    - Provide suggestions and tips for improvement.

## Content Organization

### Post Structure

I use a specific folder structure to keep my content organized. Each blog post resides in its own folder.

### The "Notes" Folder

- For each post, I create a `notes` subfolder.
- This folder is my personal space for brainstorming and gathering raw materials:
    - Rough thoughts and ideas.
    - Links to articles, studies, and other resources.
    - Images, screenshots, and other external materials.
- These notes serve as a rich context for the AI when I start writing the actual post.

## AI-Powered Writing

### Cursor as my AI Companion

- I use Cursor as my primary editor and AI assistant.
- It helps me refine my thoughts, structure my articles, and improve my writing.
- The model I primarily use is `gemini-2.5-pro`.

## Analytics

### Umami for Analytics

- **Privacy-Focused:** I chose Umami because it respects user privacy.
- **Minimal Data Collection:** It doesn't store excessive user data.
- **Simple Privacy Policy:** This choice allows me to have a straightforward and simple privacy policy for my readers.
