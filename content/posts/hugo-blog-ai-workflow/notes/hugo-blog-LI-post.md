**After some time away, I'm getting back into blogging, and collaborating with AI has made the process much smoother.**

I was stuck at first. I tried a few platforms like Obsidian and MkDocs, but they didn't quite feel right. My main goal was a simple writing process with an AI assistant at its core. After a few experiments, I settled on a stack that I'm really happy with.

My current setup is built for speed and transparency:
🛠️ **Stack:** Hugo (it's blazingly fast!) with the Congo theme, hosted on GitHub Pages.
🚀 **Deployment:** Fully automated with a GitHub Actions workflow.
🤖 **AI Collaborator:** I use Cursor.ai for everything from drafting to refining ideas.

Because I believe in sharing the complete picture, my entire blog's repository is public. You can see everything, no secrets:

📂 How I use a `notes` folder for each post to provide rich context to the AI.
📝 The way I structure these notes with my thoughts, ideas, and research findings.
⚙️ My complete Hugo and Congo theme configuration files.
📄 The full GitHub Actions `.yml` file I use for automated deployment.

I've written a post that walks through how all these pieces fit together. I hope it's helpful for anyone else looking to build a similar setup.

I'm curious to hear from others—what's your go-to platform for tech blogging and why? 👇
