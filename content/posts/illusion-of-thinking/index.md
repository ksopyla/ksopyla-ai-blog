While today's LLMs present a powerful and useful "facade of intelligence," a growing body of methodical research reveals fundamental limitations in their reasoning abilities. This evidence suggests they are not simply "scaled-down" versions of AGI but a different kind of tool altogether, and achieving true machine intelligence will require moving beyond simply scaling the current paradigm.

## Introduction: The Dazzlingâ€”and Deceptiveâ€”Facade

The pace of progress in AI is nothing short of breathtaking. Capabilities that seemed decades awayâ€”like robust translation or high-quality text summarizationâ€”are now readily available, powered by Large Language Models.
I still remember the effort required to train a domain-specific NER model; today, the same task would take an order of magnitude less time and data. 

And yet, while these models can perform with the fluency of an expert, there's a persistent feeling that something is missing. They provide genuinely helpful assistance in many tasks, but to me, it is still a **facade of intelligence**, 

However, beneath this impressive surface, a different story is unfolding. The widespread hype proclaiming the imminent arrival of AGI often overlooks the concerns of respected figures like [Yann LeCun](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yann-lecun/) and [Gary Marcus](https://garymarcus.substack.com/), along with a growing body of methodical research that reveals deep and fundamental limitations in how these models "think".

This post is a journey behind that facade. Guided by a spirit of critical optimism, we will analyze the key findings from recent studies that test the limits of LLM reasoning. My goal is not to be cynical, but to be realisticâ€”to understand what these systems truly are and what they are not. I'm driven by a core principle: you must first understand a system's boundaries before you can find a way to break through them.

## The Measurement Problem: What is "Reasoning" Anyway?

Before we can analyze the boundaries of the reasoning capabilities of the LLMs, we have to address a foundational challenge: what do we even mean by "reasoning" or "intelligence"? These concepts are notoriously difficult to define, and without a widely accepted scientific consensus, any debate on whether LLMs are truly "intelligent" quickly becomes a unproductive philosophical dispute. The conversation is even more complicated in public forums where everyone brings their own definition to the table.

Rather than getting lost in semantics, this post will take a more empirical approach. Instead of trying to define what reasoning *is*, we will test what today's models *can't do*. By examining the specific points where their performance breaks down. We can gain a much clearer, evidence-based understanding of their true capabilities and limitations.

## Cracks in the Facade: Evidence of Brittle Reasoning

The following sections will explore some of the methodical studies of the LLMs reasoning capabilities, we will focus on limitations and failures of the LLMs.

## Optimistic but not overhype

Recent developments in AI are incredible to me, its astoning to how fast the things that we considered as hard or predicted that we can't achivie them in 20-30 years are now possible. I remember the times that good NER model, summarization or translation models were a big deal, and how many effort you have to put to train them. Now those problems are solved by LLM's.
I see how much value current LLM'a are bring to our world, however I cant stand the overhype and some of marketing bullshit that claim we achive AGI. 

I want to be optimistic, but not overhype. I want to be realistic, but not pessimistic. I want to be critical, but not cynical. 
In this post I want to analyse and explore what are the main limitations of current LLM's, based on methodical studies and publicatioons. I want to know what other thinkers, reseracher and expermentators have found.

## The problem of reasoning and intelligence

I know that is hard to discuss the topic and advancement of this without proper definition.  
Unfortunately, I can't provide any definition of intelligence, resoning or understanding. 

 we did not establish the proper and widly accepted defintion, so it is hard to answer the question that some of LLM's are intelligent or can reason. The sitiuation is even more commplictaed when we try to discuss in much broader community (public space, linkedin space) then everyone has its own definition.


I don't want to dwell on them here because there are so many. So please forgive this breach of methodology.


lets focus on the problem of understanding,reasoning and intelligence and test the limits of current LLM's.
