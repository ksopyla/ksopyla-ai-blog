Frameworks and libraries are just tools. They can be learned. But the core qualities of a truly great AI/ML scientist are much rarer.

Inspired by a recent tweet from Shreya Rajpal on experimentation systems, I've been thinking about what truly sets the most impactful people in our field apart. It's not the tools they use, but their way of thinking.

I've observed three innate qualities:

1.  **Ability to See the Essence:** They can cut through the complexity of a problem to find its absolute core. This clarity allows them to design experiments that matter, avoiding wasted effort on superficial explorations.

2.  **Rigor to Test and Harvest Truth:** They have the discipline to design clean experiments, evaluate them at scale, and then dig deep into the results to separate signal from noise. It's a relentless pursuit of genuine understanding.

3.  **Vision to Connect the Dots:** They see patterns others miss, connecting ideas from seemingly unrelated fields, papers or research to incorporate them into their own work. It's a kind of creative superpower.

These are human traits, not technical skills on a resume. While tools are temporary and can be picked up on the job, this fundamentally different way of thinking is difficult to acquire, some have them, others do not.

What do you think? Are we over-indexing on specific technical skills and undervaluing these deeper, more innate qualities?
