## The initial post idea, draft 


In the article I would like to answer the questions: 

* How to create products that are AI powered? 
* How to lead the teams, and why starting with culture is important?


It is easy to start with the flaws and problems, that our brain works, we as humans easliy spot flows, problems and things that are not working (unfortunately or not I don't know to be honest)

Observed flaws: 
* do not engage the UI designer from the beginning in the process of product development, AI features discovery and refinement, the best products should start with UX and AI is just a tool to help solve user problem better and easier
* strict deadlines kill the creativity, it force the team to focus on the short term goals and use standard solutions, instead of creating something new and innovative, nobody want to risk their reputation or want to apologize, or explain yourself to your boss. So if you are in charge of the project please leave some room for the team to explore, make mistakes, and learn from them.
* leaders ego and micromanagement - I know that from my own experiecne, I want to have and influence, I want to motivate the team, but what I achive is the opposite, the frustration my and the teammates, show lack of trust therir judgement and the team is not able to grow and learn. 
* ROI, ROI, ROI - it is a good thing to measure, but I have seen many projects that were killed because of the initial ROI to low, impatient leads to short term thinking and jumping form one idea to another. Being consistent, patient and improving the product is more important than the short term ROI. It is often easy to decide that the strategically the idea is good, but it is not easy to implement it. This takes time and effort.

Building AI products is tough. I've learned a lot on this journey, mostly by getting things wrong first. üòÖ
It's easy for us to spot flaws in things, and when it comes to creating AI products and leading teams, looking at my own mistakes has been my greatest teacher. I wanted to share a few things I've learned, often the hard way, hoping it might resonate with some of you.
1. Your UI/UX designer is a partner, not a freelancer. ü§ù
I've seen it so many times: the designer is brought in, presents a UI, gets feedback, and disappears for two weeks. It's a huge mistake. The best products I've ever worked on were when we worked hand-in-hand with the designer from the very beginning. The AI is just a tool; the real journey starts with the user's problem, and that can only be solved when design and tech collaborate closely.
2. My own ego has been my biggest blocker.
This one‚Äôs personal, and it's tough to admit. In my desire to influence and motivate, I've sometimes slipped into micromanagement. The result? The exact opposite of what I intended. Frustration for me and my team, a clear signal that I didn't trust their judgment, and a team that wasn't able to grow. I'm learning that true leadership means stepping back to give the team space to explore, make mistakes, and learn from them. Strict deadlines imposed from the top don't help; they just kill the creativity we need.
3. Patience is more valuable than short-term ROI. üôè
We all love metrics, but I've seen too many promising projects killed because the initial ROI was too low. Impatience leads to short-term thinking and jumping from one idea to the next. Building something truly great requires consistency and patience. It's easy to agree on a strategic vision, but it's hard to stick with it through the messy, time-consuming process of bringing it to life.
Building with AI is a marathon of humility. I'm still learning every day.
What are your experiences? Have you faced similar challenges? I'd love to hear your stories in the comments. üëá

Observed mistakes for managing the AI produsts and teams

Post 1: UI/UX designer and AI team collaboration

* do not engage the UI designer from the beginning in the process of product development, AI features discovery and refinement, the best products should start with UX, AI is often enabler shoud be invisible and make the application works as magic, is just a tool to help solve user problem better and easier, do not treat your UI designer as a freelancer, that is transferred from project to project, but as a part of the team, that is working on the product with you.

Post 3: Why ROI kills the early stage of the product development

* ROI, ROI, ROI - it is a good thing to measure, but I have seen many projects that were killed because of the initial ROI to low, impatient leads to short term thinking and jumping form one idea to another. Being consistent, patient and improving the product is more important than the short term ROI. It is often easy to decide that the strategically the idea is good, but it is not easy to implement it.

The number one mistake I see AI product teams make repeatedly üö®

After leading AI product development for a few years, I've watched promising projects crash and burn. Not because the AI (it was called ML back then) wasn't good enough, but because of one critical oversight:

Treating your UI/UX designer like a contractor instead of a core team member.

Here's what I see happening over and over:
‚Üí AI team builds the tech
‚Üí Designer gets called in the middle or at the end of the project to design the UI
‚Üí They are briefed by the product owner or manager (do not talk with the dev team)
‚Üí Disapper for 1-2 weeks then they present mockups, collect feedback
‚Üí Repeat cycle for 2-3 times when we have run out of time and decide this is good enough
‚Üí We land with a product that feels disconnected and clunky, but works.

Good UI could hide some of the flaws of AI (latency, accuracy, etc.) and bring out the best in it.
Even if your AI capability is brilliant, if users can't intuitively interact with it, you've built an expensive tech demo.

The best AI products I've shipped felt like magic to users. The AI was completely invisible. How? We had our designer embedded with the team from day one. (I have seen this so many times, and it is a big mistake)

Instead of:
‚ùå "Here's our AI capability, design around it"
We asked:
‚úÖ "What problem are users really trying to solve?"
‚úÖ "How can AI make this feel effortless?"
‚úÖ "What's the most intuitive way to surface this intelligence?"
My advice: Stop treating design as the final polish. Make your UI/UX designer your AI product's co-architect. Give them space to explore, experiment, and challenge your technical assumptions.
The difference? Products that users actually love vs. products that impress other engineers.
What's been your experience with design-AI collaboration? Have you seen this disconnect too?
