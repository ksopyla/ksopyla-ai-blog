# Why I Started This AI Blog: A Personal Manifesto

## 🔬 A Journey Through AI Landscapes

My path through AI has been incredibly enriching—from academic research to startups to big tech—each experience taught me something valuable. Academia showed me the beauty of deep thinking and rigorous methodology. Startups taught me to move fast and focus on real problems. Corporations revealed the challenges of scaling innovation and building sustainable systems.

However, I have always wanted to have my space, to express my feelings and point of view, maybe someone will find it useful. Taking from our experiences, mixing them and conflicting will help us form new ideas and perspectives. This blog is my attempt to create that space.



## 🌍 My Core Belief: Knowledge Should Be Free

I believe deeply in **education and knowledge sharing**. Open education is one of my core values, and I've experienced firsthand how education can transform lives—it allowed me to build a good life for my family, coming from humble beginnings.

I find fulfillment in creativity and experimentation—diving deep into concepts to understand how things truly work brings me joy.  




## 🚫 Against the LLM Hype

I'm skeptical of the current AI hype and the notion that LLMs are the only path forward for AI systems. They're often inefficient, difficult to train, and expensive to run.

This approach feels like a massive waste of Earth's resources and human potential. I believe we need more efficient, effective AI systems that are accessible to everyone and easier to retrain. I'm not convinced this is the right path toward truly reasoning machines.


## 🔄 Rediscovering the Old, Exploring the New

Unlike the tendency to dismiss others' work, I believe even the smallest experiment can teach us something valuable. I enjoy revisiting older concepts and architectures, rediscovering forgotten techniques and ideas (as projects like ModernBERT have shown). Sometimes the future lies in better understanding our past.

## 🎯 What to Expect from This Blog

Here, you'll find:

- **🤔 Personal takes** on ML research, interesting ideas, papers, and projects
- **🧠 Critical analysis** of AI trends without falling for hype
- **🔧 Practical insights** from someone who's led R&D teams and built real products
- **📚 Educational content** that makes complex concepts accessible
- **🌱 Open science advocacy** and discussions on AI's ethical implications

This isn't just another AI blog rehashing press releases. It's a space for honest reflection on where AI is heading and where it should go. Whether you're a researcher, engineer, or simply curious about AI's impact on our world, I hope you'll find value in these explorations.

*Welcome to a different kind of AI conversation—one grounded in experience, guided by values, and committed to genuine understanding over flashy demos.*
