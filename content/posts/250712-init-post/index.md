# Why I Started This AI Blog: A Personal Manifesto

## A Journey Through AI Landscapes

Let me start by sharing a bit about my journey through the life and work in AI. My path through AI has been incredibly enriching‚Äîfrom academic research to startups to big tech‚Äîeach experience taught me something valuable. Academia showed me the beauty of deep thinking and rigorous methodology. Startups taught me to move fast and focus on real problems. Corporations revealed the challenges of scaling innovation and building sustainable systems.

But despite these valuable lessons, I have always wanted to have my space, to express my feelings, my thoughts and point of view. 
 I always believed that taking from our experiences, mixing them and conflicting will help us form new ideas and perspectives. So I hope this space will be useful to someone, spark meaningful conversations or help formulate new ideas. 


## My Core Beliefs and values that I want to share

I believe deeply in **education and knowledge**. Especially, open and accessible education is one of my core values. I've experienced firsthand how education can transform lives‚Äîit allowed me to build a good life for my family, coming from humble beginnings. Thats why you see the tutorials and my understanding of AI concepts on this blog.

Secondly, I find fulfillment in creativity and experimentation. Diving deep into concepts to understand how things truly work brings me joy. I enjoy exploring the nuances of ML algorithms and architectures, from the theoretical underpinnings to practical applications. 

Through my career, I have found experimentation an extremely useful tool for understanding and developing new ideas. Any simple experiment or reproduction of existing work teaches me something valuable. I will try to share my experiments and findings here, hoping they will be useful to others as well.

## Against the LLM Hype

I'm skeptical of the current AI hype and the notion that LLMs are the only path forward for AI systems. They're often inefficient, difficult to train, and expensive to run.

This approach feels like a massive waste of Earth's resources and human potential. I believe we need more efficient, effective AI systems that are accessible to everyone and easier to retrain. I'm not convinced this is the right path toward truly reasoning machines.


## üîÑ Rediscovering the Old, Exploring the New

Unlike the tendency to dismiss others' work, I believe even the smallest experiment can teach us something valuable. I enjoy revisiting older concepts and architectures, rediscovering forgotten techniques and ideas (as projects like ModernBERT have shown). Sometimes the future lies in better understanding our past.

## üéØ What to Expect from This Blog

Here, you'll find:

- **ü§î Personal takes** on ML research, interesting ideas, papers, and projects
- **üß† Critical analysis** of AI trends without falling for hype
- **üîß Practical insights** from someone who's led R&D teams and built real products
- **üìö Educational content** that makes complex concepts accessible
- **üå± Open science advocacy** and discussions on AI's ethical implications

I treat it as a  space for honest reflection on where AI is heading and where it should go. Whether you're a researcher, engineer, or simply curious about AI's impact on our world, I hope you'll find value in these explorations.
