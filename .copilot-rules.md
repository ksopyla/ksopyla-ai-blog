# Copilot Rules for Krzysztof Sopyla AI Blog

## Project Context
This is a Hugo static site blog focused on AI, machine learning, and programming topics using the Congo theme.

## File Structure and Conventions
- Content files are in Markdown format in `content/` directory
- Blog posts go in `content/posts/YYMMDD-post-slug/` format
- Configuration files are in TOML format in `config/_default/`
- Static assets go in `assets/` and `static/` directories
- The Congo theme is installed as a git submodule in `themes/congo/`

## Content Writing Guidelines
- All blog posts must have proper YAML frontmatter with title, date, draft status, tags, and categories
- Use Hugo shortcodes like `{{< lead >}}` for special formatting
- Code blocks should specify the language for proper syntax highlighting
- Images should be placed in the same directory as the post's `index.md`
- Post directories should follow the naming convention: `YYMMDD-descriptive-slug/`
- Each post folder should contain an `index.md` file with the post content and has its own notes folder with additional topic realted context and materials 

## Hugo Configuration
- Site uses Congo theme with profile layout for homepage
- Configuration is split across multiple TOML files in `config/_default/`
- Sharing links are limited to: x-twitter, linkedin, reddit, mastodon, bluesky
- Comments are enabled but no comments system is currently configured
- Search is disabled (`enableSearch = false`)
- Congo theme is used for layout and styling, documentation is available at [Congo documentation](https://jpanther.github.io/congo/docs/) use it for reference

## Development Workflow
- Use `hugo server --buildDrafts --buildFuture` for local development
- The `public/` directory is gitignored (build output)
- Git submodules are used for theme management
- SSH configuration uses separate keys for personal vs enterprise GitHub accounts

## Content Focus Areas
- Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning
- PyTorch and deep learning frameworks
- Research paper reviews and analysis
- Programming tutorials and best practices
- AI benchmark analysis (like GLUE)

## Code Style Preferences
- Python code examples should include proper imports and context
- Bash scripts should include proper shebang and error handling
- Code blocks should be complete and runnable when possible
- Prefer clear, educational examples over complex implementations

## Markdown Conventions
- Use semantic heading hierarchy (H1 for post title, H2 for main sections)
- Include reading time and word count metadata
- Use Hugo's built-in syntax highlighting
- Add alt text for images
- Use Hugo shortcodes for enhanced functionality

## Git and Deployment
- Commit only source files, not generated content
- Use conventional commit messages
- The site deploys to https://ai.ksopyla.com/


## When suggesting code or content:
1. Always consider the Hugo static site context
2. Use Congo theme-specific shortcodes and features
3. Follow the established directory structure
4. Include proper frontmatter for new posts
5. Consider SEO and social sharing implications
6. Maintain consistency with existing content style
